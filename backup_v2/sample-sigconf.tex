\begin{abstract}
  Operating system schedulers face a fundamental semantic gap: kernel policies cannot comprehend application-level requirements, leading to suboptimal performance. We present SchedCP, the first framework enabling autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to dynamically optimize Linux schedulers. SchedCP operates as a control plane that decouples high-level policy synthesis from low-level execution. The framework leverages a hybrid AI approach: the LLM agent first performs semantic workload analysis to select, modify, or generate a tailored scheduling algorithm as an eBPF program. Following this initial synthesis, the framework can employ targeted reinforcement learning to perform continuous, fine-grained tuning of the deployed scheduler's numerical parameters, adapting to workload dynamics. Our design is governed by a safety-first principle, using an "Execution Gauntlet" with static and dynamic checks to securely validate all agent-generated code before deployment. Built on the production-ready sched\_ext infrastructure, schedulers execute as native eBPF with zero LLM overhead in the critical path. Our evaluation demonstrates that SchedCP achieves up to an 80\% speedup for Linux kernel builds and a 50\% latency reduction for scheduler benchmarks. By maintaining a self-evolving library of policies, SchedCP shows that AI-driven OS optimization is not only feasible but also practical, paving the way for intelligent systems that learn from their workloads.
