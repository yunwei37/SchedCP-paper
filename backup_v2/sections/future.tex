\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

While \sys demonstrates the viability of AI-driven scheduler optimization, extending our framework beyond schedulers to cache policies, DVFS, network configuration, and sysctl parameters presents immediate opportunities for a unified OS optimization framework. Cross-component optimization—where CPU, memory, I/O, and power decisions inform each other—could unlock significant performance gains through new abstractions for expressing inter-component dependencies. The broader impact extends beyond technical improvements: \sys democratizes OS optimization by enabling application-specific kernel policies without requiring kernel expertise, effectively bridging the gap between application needs and kernel capabilities. This work opens new possibilities for adaptive, application-aware operating systems that can automatically optimize themselves for changing workloads, making expert-level performance accessible to all users.
