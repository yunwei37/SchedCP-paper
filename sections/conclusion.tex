\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced \sys, the first framework designed to empower autonomous LLM agents to safely and efficiently optimize Linux schedulers. Our core contribution is a decoupled control plane architecture that cleanly separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning from the system's role of safe execution, bridging the critical semantic gap between application needs and kernel policy. We demonstrated through \agent that this approach not only achieves significant performance improvements up to a 1.79Ã— speedup and an 88\% cost reduction over naive agentic methods, but also maintains system stability by autonomously synthesizing and deploying custom eBPF scheduling policies. By providing a stable, verifiable interface for AI-driven optimization, SchedCP represents a foundational step towards a new generation of agentic, self-optimizing operating systems that are truly application-aware.
