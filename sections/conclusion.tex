\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduce \sys, the first framework for autonomous LLM agents to safely optimize Linux schedulers. Its decoupled control plane separates AI reasoning from safe system execution, bridging the gap between application needs and kernel policy. Our agent, \agent, achieved up to a 1.79Ã— speedup and a 13x cost reduction over naive approaches by autonomously generating and deploying custom eBPF scheduling policies while ensuring stability. SchedCP offers a stable interface for AI-driven optimization, marking a foundational step towards truly application-aware, self-optimizing operating systems.
