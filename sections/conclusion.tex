We present \sys, the first framework for using fully automatic LLM agents to dynamically optimize Linux schedulers. By maintaining a self-evolving library of schedulers and leveraging reinforcement learning for continuous improvement, our system achieves significant performance gains while reducing the expertise required for OS optimization. This work opens new possibilities for adaptive, application-aware operating systems that can automatically optimize themselves for changing workloads. This work has implications beyond schedulers. As AI agents become more powerful, the interfaces we design today will shape how AI interacts with systems software tomorrow. \sys demonstrates that with proper design, AI can democratize system optimizationâ€”making expert-level performance accessible to users from cloud operators to gamers, while paving the way for truly self-optimizing operating systems.
