\section{Conclusion}

We present \sys{}, a novel approach to dynamic scheduling that uses an LLM-driven agent to create and configure schedulers on the fly. By exploiting the LLM's semantic understanding and combining it with RL optimization, \sys{} automatically adapts to diverse workloads and achieves better performance than static heuristics or pure RL. Our design answers the key challenges of scheduling in modern environments: it eliminates the need for human expertise in tuning, supports complex and multi-objective goals, and generalizes across domains. In future work we will explore tighter integration (e.g. real hardware prototypes) and richer multi-agent cooperation (multiple LLM agents scheduling different subsystems). We believe this work points the way toward \emph{intelligent, self-driving schedulers} that can keep up with the pace of evolving workloads.
