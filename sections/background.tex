This section reviews the two core technologies for our work: extensible kernel scheduling and autonomous LLM agents.

\subsection{eBPF and sched\_ext}

Linux's default Earliest Eligible Virtual Deadline First (EEVDF) scheduler~\cite{eevdf2024}, which replaced CFS in kernel 6.6, is a one-size-fits-all policy that, while ensuring fairness through virtual deadlines, is unoptimized for diverse workloads. To address this, sched\_ext~\cite{schedext2024}, introduced in Linux 6.12, enables the dynamic loading of custom schedulers as eBPF programs, providing hooks for task enqueueing, CPU selection, load balancing, and idle management. This relies on eBPF~\cite{ebpfio}, which evolved from a simple packet filter into a general-purpose, in-kernel virtual machine. Now powering modern observability and security tools~\cite{tracee,cilium} on both Linux and other systems like Windows and userspace~\cite{zheng2025extending, windows-ebpf}, its verifier guarantees safety through static analysis, preventing crashes, invalid memory access, and infinite loops. Previous work also explores using LLM for eBPF code generation\cite{kgent}.

\subsection{LLMs and Autonomous Agents}

The application of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4~\cite{openai2023gpt4} and Claude~\cite{anthropic2024claude} has evolved from code generation to system maintenance~\cite{de2025llm} and fully autonomous agents. These agents typically use an architecture with an LLM backend, a tool framework, and a control loop, as seen in popular frameworks like LangChain~\cite{langchain}, AutoGen~\cite{autogen} and commercial tools like Cursor Agent~\cite{cursor}, Gemini-CLI~\cite{geminicli}, and Claude Code~\cite{claudecode} for automate software engineering workflows. Further research into multi-agent frameworks like ChatDev~\cite{qian2024chatdev} and MetaGPT for software development~\cite{hong2023metagpt}, repo understanding~\cite{coderesearcher2025}, and simulate social behaviors~\cite{agent4se2024} has shown that role-playing can boost code generation and issue localization~\cite{Lin2025FlowGen,Batole2025LocalizeAgent}. Despite these advances, the tools remain developer aids, not autonomous low-level system optimizers.
