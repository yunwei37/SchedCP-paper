\sys's principles can extend naturally to memory management (custom page replacement policies, NUMA optimization), I/O scheduling (NVMe-specific algorithms), and power management (intelligent DVFS policies). Cross-component optimization coordinating CPU, memory, I/O, and power decisions holistically presents significant opportunities, as does leveraging advances in LLMs like multi-modal understanding and million-token context windows for more complex system optimization tasks. Key research challenges include formal verification of AI-generated schedulers and understanding theoretical performance improvement bounds when applying semantic understanding to systems optimization.
