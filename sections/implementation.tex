\section{Implementation}

\subsection{MCP Server Implementation}

Our MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides the interface between AI agents and the production system. Built with Python FastAPI, it exposes RESTful endpoints for workload submission, scheduler retrieval, and performance monitoring. WebSocket support enables real-time metric streaming for continuous optimization. Authentication via API keys and rate limiting prevent abuse while allowing multiple agents to share the infrastructure. The server implements request prioritization based on SLAs, ensuring critical workloads receive timely optimization. All operations are logged for audit trails, capturing agent decisions and performance impacts for post-mortem analysis.

\subsection{Scheduler Library Management}

The scheduler library serves as institutional memory, storing successful implementations for reuse. We use Git for version control, tracking evolution of schedulers over time with full history. JSON metadata captures scheduler descriptions, performance characteristics, and applicability conditions. SQLite indexes performance metrics across deployments, enabling statistical analysis of effectiveness. Semantic embeddings via Sentence-BERT enable natural language search, finding relevant schedulers from high-level descriptions. Automatic indexing processes new schedulers, extracting patterns and updating the knowledge base. Performance regression detection flags schedulers showing degraded results, maintaining library quality over time.

\subsection{Code Generation Pipeline}

Our pipeline transforms AI intent into deployable schedulers through multiple stages. Template selection matches workload descriptions to proven patterns, providing starting points for customization. Parameter injection adapts templates with workload-specific values, maintaining correctness while optimizing performance. Static validation catches errors before kernel interaction, running syntax checks, type verification, and safety analysis. Incremental compilation reduces iteration time by caching intermediate results and reusing unchanged components. The pipeline integrates feedback loops, using compilation errors and test results to guide AI refinement.

\subsection{Safety Implementation}

Safety permeates every layer of our implementation. The validation pipeline implements defense-in-depth: syntax checking with clang-format ensures well-formed code, BPF verifier pre-check simulates kernel verification catching common issues early, resource analysis proves bounded execution avoiding infinite loops, and security scanning detects potential vulnerabilities. Runtime protection includes automatic fallback mechanisms reverting to CFS on anomalies, performance monitoring with configurable thresholds triggering alerts, resource quotas preventing runaway consumption, and comprehensive audit logging for debugging and compliance. Our gradual rollout system tests schedulers on increasing workload percentages, monitoring key metrics at each stage before full deployment.

\subsection{Key Technical Challenges and Solutions}

\subsubsection{Code Generation Efficiency}

LLM agents cannot accurately estimate execution time and performance from code alone. Our experiments revealed AI schedulers produce unexpected performance due to subtle implementation choices with major runtime impacts. A linked list for task queuing causes cache misses and traversal overhead that degrades performance under load. Performance emerges from component interactions—data structure choices in one function create bottlenecks in another, making static analysis predictions unreliable. We address this by combining static and dynamic analysis. LLMs excel at pattern recognition and code generation but require empirical performance data and domain heuristics for efficient schedulers.

\textbf{Profile-Guided Optimization}: We maintain performance profiles for scheduler patterns from thousands of executions. When LLMs generate code, we match fragments against this database to predict performance. Example: red-black trees provide O(log n) insertion but have higher constants than arrays for small task counts. We correlate code features (loop nesting, data structures, memory patterns) with runtime behavior, enabling informed trade-offs before costly testing.

\textbf{Lightweight Static Analysis}: Our custom framework analyzes eBPF instruction sequences to estimate complexity and identify performance degradation patterns. It detects anti-patterns: excessive branching that defeats branch prediction, inefficient data structures causing cache thrashing, memory patterns triggering TLB misses. This feedback guides LLMs toward efficient implementations without full compilation. Analysis completes in milliseconds, enabling rapid iteration.

\textbf{Incremental Refinement}: We use incremental refinement that mirrors human expert development. AI starts with conservative, correct implementations prioritizing safety over performance. Through iterative profiling, we identify bottlenecks and generate targeted optimizations. Each optimization is A/B tested against previous versions to ensure real improvements. This avoids premature optimization while systematically improving efficiency based on evidence.

\subsection{Token Consumption Management}

\subsubsection{Challenge}
Token consumption challenges arise from system programming complexity. Large codebases, API documentation, and kernel interfaces require extensive context that exhausts token limits and increases costs. Initial experiments: one scheduler consumed 200+ API calls processing thousands of tokens while navigating kernel docs, examining implementations, and refining code. Current pricing makes widespread deployment economically infeasible. Context scatters across sources—work-stealing schedulers require kernel code, BPF docs, sched\_ext examples, and tuning guides.

\subsubsection{Solution}
We implemented intelligent context management that reduces token consumption while maintaining quality. Strategic context selection achieves better results than providing maximum information.

\textbf{Hierarchical Code Understanding}: Our hierarchical system presents code at multiple abstraction levels. Schedulers are summarized in sentences describing strategy and characteristics. AI requests specific subsections for algorithms or data structures. Many decisions use concise summaries rather than full implementations. We cache intermediate representations for reuse. This reduces token consumption by 75\% compared to full code context.

\textbf{Focus on Critical Paths}: Profiling shows <10\% of code accounts for >90\% execution time. We identify performance-critical sections for detailed analysis. Non-critical initialization, error handling, and diagnostics receive minimal attention using templates and heuristics. Token budget focuses where performance matters while maintaining correctness.

\textbf{Semantic Compression}: We extract patterns from successful schedulers into parameterized templates. Complex algorithms become primitive combinations. Work-stealing becomes "WORK\_STEALING(steal\_threshold=3, migration\_cost=1000, numa\_aware=true)" instead of hundreds of lines. AI uses abstractions for design, expanding to code for generation. This achieves 90\% token reduction for common patterns.

\subsection{Safety Guarantees}

\subsubsection{Challenge}
Ensuring AI-generated kernel code safety is our most critical challenge. Kernel errors cause system crashes, data corruption, security vulnerabilities, and performance degradation affecting all applications. LLMs lack the caution human developers gain from years of experience. AI might generate syntactically correct code that passes basic tests but contains race conditions, memory issues, or performance pathologies appearing under specific conditions. Traditional testing is insufficient—schedulers must handle edge cases from memory pressure to unusual task patterns, where errors destabilize systems.

\subsubsection{Solution}
We treat AI code as potentially hostile, applying defense-in-depth to prevent single failures from compromising stability. Our multi-layered approach protects systems even with problematic AI code through independent safety mechanisms.

\textbf{Static Analysis Pipeline}: Four-stage pipeline defends against unsafe code. First, syntax validation ensures C/BPF compliance, catching basic errors. Second, BPF verifier pre-check simulates kernel verification by examining control flow, memory access, and helper usage. Third, resource bound analysis proves loop termination and bounded memory using loop invariants and symbolic execution. Finally, security audit scans for buffer/integer overflows and info leaks. The pipeline catches >95\% of safety issues before kernel loading.

\textbf{Sandboxed Testing Environment}: Schedulers prove safety in isolated VMs with production kernel configs. Test suites simulate workloads from normal to pathological edge cases. Testing includes memory pressure, rapid task creation/destruction, priority inversions, and CPU hotplug. We monitor correctness and performance, flagging degradation from baseline. The sandbox simulates months of runtime in hours through accelerated testing for long-term stability confidence.

\textbf{Gradual Rollout Mechanism}: After passing tests, we deploy cautiously. Initial deployment affects 1\% of workload while monitoring latency percentiles, CPU utilization, context switches, and app-specific metrics. Healthy metrics for one hour trigger automatic increases: 5\%, 25\%, 50\%, 100\%. Any anomalies—performance degradation, errors, instability—instantly revert to the previous scheduler. This has prevented numerous production issues, providing critical safety for AI code.

\subsection{Performance Validation}

\subsubsection{Challenge}
Validating AI scheduler performance exceeds traditional benchmarking requirements. Scheduler performance is workload-dependent—excellence in web serving might mean poor scientific computing performance. Performance spans latency, throughput, fairness, and power efficiency, with workloads prioritizing differently. We must detect subtle regressions absent from synthetic benchmarks but impacting real applications. Schedulers might show excellent averages while having latency spikes unsuitable for real-time use. Validation itself cannot become a bottleneck—comprehensive testing traditionally takes hours or days.

\subsubsection{Solution}
Our validation balances thoroughness with efficiency, ensuring only schedulers that meet or exceed human expert performance reach production.

\textbf{Multi-Stage Validation}: Four stages catch different performance issues. First, microbenchmarks measure task enqueueing latency, scheduling decisions, and load balancing overhead in microseconds. Second, synthetic workloads stress different aspects—CPU-bound tests for throughput, I/O-bound tests for responsiveness, mixed tests for diverse handling. Third, real applications (web servers, databases, batch jobs) validate realistic performance. Finally, production shadowing runs schedulers alongside existing ones without enforcement for risk-free comparison. This completes in <30 minutes with comprehensive validation.

\textbf{Performance Metrics Framework}: We track comprehensive metrics capturing scheduler performance aspects. Latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99, p99.9) reveal typical and worst-case response times affecting user experience. Throughput at 10-200\% capacity ensures proper scaling. CPU efficiency detects wasted cycles from unnecessary operations or poor placement. Context switch overhead quantifies direct scheduling costs; cache performance measures indirect costs via miss rates and bandwidth. The framework generates scorecards comparing against baselines and historical bests for clear accept/reject decisions.

\textbf{Continuous Monitoring}: Validation continues post-deployment by tracking scheduler behavior. Real-time dashboards show metrics with second-level granularity for rapid anomaly detection. ML models trained on historical data identify unusual patterns indicating degradation. Automatic reports summarize daily/weekly/monthly trends, highlighting concerns. Feedback loops channel performance data to AI agents for continuous learning. When workload characteristics shift significantly, the system triggers optimized scheduler regeneration for true adaptation.


\subsection{Implementation Details}

\subsubsection{Technology Stack}
Our stack balances performance, reliability, and productivity. The core framework uses Python 3.11+ for async handling of concurrent LLM requests and system operations. It supports multiple LLM providers: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, and local models via Ollama for deployment flexibility. BPF toolchain includes libbpf for programmatic interaction, bpftool for debugging, and clang-15+ for compilation. Monitoring uses Prometheus with custom exporters and OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing. Testing employs pytest for unit/integration tests, sysbench for benchmarks, and custom workload generators.

\subsubsection{Performance Optimizations}
Performance optimization permeates every layer. Redis caching stores LLM responses, analysis results, and compilation artifacts, reducing redundant computation and API costs by 60\%. Intelligent expiration balances storage costs with hit rates. Parallel processing runs validation concurrently across cores and distributed systems. Incremental compilation tracks dependencies, rebuilding only changes and reducing compilation time by 80\%. Profile-guided optimization feeds runtime data back to generation—AI learns successful patterns and biases future generation toward them.

\subsubsection{Deployment Architecture}
Deployment separates control and data planes for scalability. The control plane REST API lets AI agents submit requests, retrieve schedulers, and access metrics. It implements rate limiting, authentication, and prioritization to prevent abuse. The data plane uses eBPF for high-performance metric collection with minimal overhead. Metrics flow through pipelines processing millions of events per second. Time-series databases (InfluxDB/Prometheus) store historical data for trend analysis. Kubernetes operators orchestrate AI agents, scheduler deployments, and monitoring. This cloud-native approach scales from single servers to large clusters.
