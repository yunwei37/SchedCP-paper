# Sched-Agent: Review and Improvement Plan for OSDI Submission

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive review of the Sched-Agent paper and outlines a detailed improvement plan to meet the standards of top-tier systems conferences like OSDI. The paper presents an innovative approach combining LLM reasoning with RL optimization for dynamic scheduler generation, but requires significant enhancements in implementation depth, evaluation rigor, and technical contributions.

## Current Paper Strengths

### 1. Novel System Design
- **Innovative Architecture**: First system to combine LLM-based policy generation with RL fine-tuning for scheduling
- **Practical DSL Design**: Well-motivated domain-specific language bridging LLM output and system execution
- **Generalization Focus**: Addresses real pain points in scheduler design across diverse workloads

### 2. Clear Problem Motivation
- Effectively articulates limitations of static schedulers in modern HPC/cloud environments
- Good positioning against both traditional and ML-based scheduling approaches
- Compelling vision of "self-driving schedulers"

### 3. Comprehensive Related Work
- Thorough coverage of scheduling literature across multiple domains
- Clear differentiation from existing RL-only and autotuning approaches

## Critical Weaknesses and Required Improvements

  - Convergence time comparisons
- Include detailed experimental setup:
  - Hardware specifications
  - Workload characteristics (size, complexity)
  - Training time and resource requirements
- Add confidence intervals and statistical tests
- Include ablation studies showing contribution of each component

### 3. Weak Technical Depth (Priority: High)

**Current Issues:**

  - How does RL feedback improve LLM generation?
  - What prevents mode collapse or policy degradation?
- Add theoretical analysis:
  - Convergence properties
  - Sample complexity bounds
  - Generalization guarantees
- Discuss DSL expressiveness vs. tractability tradeoffs

### 4. Limited Real-World Validation (Priority: High)

**Current Issues:**
- Only simulation-based evaluation
- No production deployment experience
- Missing discussion of practical deployment challenges

**Required Improvements:**
- Add real system implementation on actual clusters
- Include case studies from production workloads
- Discuss integration challenges with existing schedulers
- Add user study or expert evaluation of generated policies

### 5. Scalability Concerns (Priority: Medium)

**Current Issues:**
- No discussion of scalability limits

- No evaluation on large-scale systems

**Required Improvements:**
- Add scalability evaluation:
  - Performance vs. cluster size
  - Policy generation time vs. workload complexity
  - Memory and compute requirements
- Discuss amortization strategies for LLM costs
